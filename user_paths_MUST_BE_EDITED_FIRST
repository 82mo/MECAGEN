# QT paths
##########

# Replace the values of the following two variables with the paths occupied by qt5 on your system:
QTINCLUDEPATH=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5
QTLIBPATH=/usr/lib/qt5

# CUDA OR THRUST
################

# Edit one of the following options *and* comment the other one. Depending on your choice, the MecaGen compilation will use CUDA rendering or not.

# Option 1 (Recommended): 
# Replace here with your CUDA path if you are using CUDA. It must be the directory that contains an "include" subfolder.
# CUDAPATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.4/targets/x86_64-linux

# Option 2:
# Replace here with the path that contains the THRUST folder (not directly the THRUST path) if you are not using CUDA:
THRUSTPATH=/home/julien/Downloads/thrust-1.7.0
